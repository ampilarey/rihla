/**
 * Machine-generated filler, shipped as Dhivehi.
 *
 * The site's Dhivehi was not merely incomplete — parts of it were fabricated,
 * and the giveaway is always the same: many different English strings mapping
 * to one identical Dhivehi string.
 *
 * `resources/lang/dv/guide.php` held 19 keys with 3 distinct values. "Step",
 * "of", "Table of Contents", "Checklist", "Fiqh Notes", "Du'a", "Reference",
 * "Previous Step" and eight more all rendered as one word, which appeared 31
 * times on the live Dhivehi guide page. `dv/messages.php` had 99 keys sharing
 * a value with another key, including a file-upload instruction sharing one
 * with "Edit".
 *
 * Worst of all, the ten seeded Dhivehi guide steps carried the *same* du'a and
 * the same reference_text as each other, where the ten English steps carry ten
 * real supplications and citations. A Dhivehi pilgrim reading the du'a for
 * Niyyah, Ihram, Tawaf and Sa'i was given one meaningless sentence each time,
 * under a heading claiming it was the supplication for that rite.
 *
 * None of it was replaced with a paraphrase. Inventing religious text would be
 * a worse defect than the one being fixed.
